# Basic Usage Example
#
# This workflow demonstrates basic usage of the check-tag-action:
# - On pull requests: check that version has been bumped
# - On main branch: create release tags

name: Basic CI/CD

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  # Validate version was bumped in PRs
  check-version:
    if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Check version
        uses: lindenlab/check-tag-action@v1
        with:
          mode: check

  # Run tests (example)
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Run tests
        run: |
          echo "Running tests..."
          # Add your test commands here
          # make test

  # Create release tag when merged to main
  tag-release:
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
    steps:
      - name: Create release tag
        uses: lindenlab/check-tag-action@v1
        with:
          mode: tag

      # Optional: use the created tag for other steps
      - name: Print created tag
        run: echo "Created tag ${{ steps.tag.outputs.tag }}"
